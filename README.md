# concourse-docker-compose-resource

A Concourse CI resource that executes [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 
against a remote host.

## Resource Type Configuration

```bash
resource_types:
- name: docker-compose
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: troykinsella/concourse-docker-compose-resource
    tag: latest
```

## Source Configuration

* `ca_certs`: Optional. A list of objects having the following keys.
  Configures CA certificates for docker registry domains.
  * `domain`: The domain of the docker registry.
  * `cert`: The CA certificate for the domain.

  Each entry specifies the x509 CA certificate for the trusted docker registry 
  residing at the specified domain. This is used to validate the certificate of 
  the docker registry when the registry's certificate is signed by a custom 
  authority (or itself).

  The domain should match the first component of repository, including the port. 

* `host`: Required. The hostname of the Docker host to connect to.
* `port`: Optional. Default: 2376. The port on the Docker host to connect to.
* `registries`: Optional. A list of objects having the following keys.
  Performs a `docker login` to the listed registries in order to pull images from
  private registries, for example. 
  * `host`: 
  * `username`:
  * `password`:
* `verbose`: Optional. Default: false. Enable verbose output from `docker-compose`.

### Example

```bash
resources:
- name: docker-compose
  type: docker-compose
  source:
    host: docker-01.your.org
    registries:
    - host: docker-registry.your.org
      username: you
      password: 1nsecure
    ca_certs:
    - domain: docker-registry.your.org
      cert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ...
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

## Behaviour

### `check`: No-Op

### `in`: No-Op

### `out`: Execute `docker-compose`

#### Parameters

* `command`: Optional. Default: `up`. Specify the command to run with `docker-compose`.
  Supported commands are:
  * `down`
  * `kill`
  * `restart`
  * `start`
  * `stop`
  * `up`
* `compose_file`: Optional. Default: `docker-compose.yml`. Specify the name of the Compose file,
  relative to `path`.
* `options`: Optional. Supply command-specific options. Options names correlate to 
  `docker-compose` command options.
  * `down` options:
    * `rmi`: String. Remove images. Type must be one of:
      * `all`: Remove all images used by any service.
      * `local`: Remove only images that don't have a
        custom tag set by the `image` field.
    * `volumes`: Boolean. Remove named volumes declared in the `volumes`
      section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes attached to containers.
    * `remove_orphans`: Boolean. Remove containers for services not defined
      in the Compose file.
    * `timeout`: Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds.
  * `kill` options:
    * `signal`: SIGNAL to send to the container.
  * `restart` options:
    * `timeout`: Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds.
  * `start` options: (none)
  * `stop` options:
    * `timeout`: Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds.
  * `up` options:
    * `no_deps`: Boolean. Don't start linked services.
    * `force_recreate`: Boolean. Recreate containers even if their configuration
      and image haven't changed.
    * `no_recreate`: Boolean. If containers already exist, don't recreate
      them. Incompatible with `force_recreate` and `renew-anon-volumes`.
    * `renew-anon-volumes`: Boolean. Recreate anonymous volumes instead of retrieving
      data from the previous containers.
    * `remove_orphans`: Boolean. Remove containers for services not defined
      in the Compose file.
    * `scale`: Object of service name keys to scale integer values. 
       Scale SERVICE to NUM instances. Overrides the `scale` setting in the 
       Compose file if present. For example:
       * ```bash
         scale:
           service_a: 3
           service_b: 1
         ```
     * `timeout`: Use this timeout in seconds for container shutdown when attached or when 
       containers are already running.
* `path`: Optional. The directory in which `docker-compose` will be executed.
* `print`: Optional. Default: false. Print the contents of the Compose file.
* `project`: Optional. Specify the project name, which is prepended to container names.
* `services`: Optional. Only relevant to the `kill`, `restart`, `start`, `stop`, and `up` commands. 
  A list of services named in the Compose file on which `docker-compose` will operate.
* `wait_before`: Optional. The number of seconds to wait (sleep) before executing `docker-compose`.
* `wait_after`: Optional. The number of seconds to wait (sleep) after executing `docker-compose`.

#### Example

```bash
# Extends example in Source Configuration

jobs:
- name:
  plan:
  - do:
    - get: code # git resource
    - put: docker-compose
      params:
        command: up

        path: code
        services:
        - service_a
        options:
          scale:
            service_a: 1
        wait_after: 3 # Let services come up
    - task: integration tests
      file: ...
      input_mapping:

        path: code
        options:
          volumes: true
```
